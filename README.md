# VBA-challenge

This project was created to automate the analysis of large datasets that include quarterly data for tens to hundreds of stock ticker symbols.  The code created for this process also applies conditional formatting to maintain consistent and dependable outputs, regardless of the number of lines of data for a given quarter.  This code is also able to run the code across multiple worksheets within a given workbook.

Limitations: Code was created with the assumptions that the data provided will always be provided sorted by ticker symbol, then by trade date. Also, the data provided will be a full quarter's data per worksheet.
