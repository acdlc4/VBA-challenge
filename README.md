# VBA-challenge

The purpose of this project is to automate the analysis of large datasets of quarterly data for tens to hundreds of stock ticker symbols, easily saving hours upon hours of repetitive manual work.  The code created for this process also applies conditional formatting to maintain consistent and dependable outputs, regardless of the number of lines of data for a given quarter.  This code is also able to run the code across multiple worksheets within a given workbook.

Limitations: The code was written with the assumption that the data provided will always be provided sorted by ticker symbol, then by trade date. Also, the data provided will consist of a full quarter's data per worksheet.
